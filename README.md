# Emotion_Detection
Here, I am using pre-trained machine learning object detection haar cascade(one of the oldest object detection model, to detect face), openv and deepface library to implement emotion detection using python language.
Detectemotion.py file will be detecting emotion for images. Here i have downloaded random image(happy.jpg) from google. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file contains
pre-trained machine learning algorithm that will be used for object detection. realtime.py file will detect emotion in realtime.
